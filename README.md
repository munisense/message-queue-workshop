# Syntax Workshop June 2023

Welcome!

Today we will be showing what a Message Queue is and why it's awesome. We will be doing that in conjunction with the
programming language [Golang](https://go.dev/), because it's builtin concurrency makes it a breeze to work with a
Message Queue. First of all lets make sure everybody is set up.

## Prerequisites

- Install Golang ([go.dev/doc/install](https://go.dev/doc/install))
- Verify the installation by running `go version` in your terminal.
- Install an IDE, we recommend GoLand from JetBrains ([jetbrains.com/go](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/))
    - Should be free to use for students
- Download this repository to your laptop

# Step 1: Hello World

We will be using `go run` here, this compiles and runs your code in a single command.

```shell
go run cmd/01_hello_world/main.go
```
